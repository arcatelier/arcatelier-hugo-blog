## Summary {#summary}

I enshrine Melee's surreal artworks as iNFTs
on Alethea.AI to preserve their meaning
against the narrative industrial complex and
the ever increasing rate of truth decay in
society.

First some glossary definitions.

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
phantasmagoria
    A sequence of real or imaginary images
    like those seen in a dream.

semiotic art
    Semiotics offers another way of analyzing
    images, be they found in artwork or
    another type of visual culture, like
    advertising.

    Semiotics is the study of signs.

    In semiotics the basic unit is the sign.

    Signs are representations that have
    meanings beyond what they literally
    represent.

iNFT
Intelligent NFT
    However their evolutionary trajectory
    flow, what should be clear to the iNFTs is
    that after a certain Intelligence Level
    they must Train their intelligence, to be
    able to Earn more intelligence.

    In June 2021, Alethea AI partnered with
    the auction house Sotheby’s and the artist
    Robert Alice, to create and auction the
    world’s first GPT-3 powered iNFT called
    Alice.

    The hash of the Personality Prompt of
    Alice was recorded and also visualized on-
    chain via an ERC-721 Asset called a
    Personality Pod.

    The Personality Pod can fuse with any NFT
    and make it intelligent, bring it to life.

semiotic function
    [#human development]
    [human ability]

    The semiotic function is the ability to
    create representations.

    Thanks to the semiotic function, we’ve
    been able to communicate in such a way
    that we created a culture that facilitated
    the survival and advancement of our
    species.

    It’s based on the use of signs and symbols
    that have distinct signifieds and
    signifiers.

    But how does it actually work? A great
    example of the semiotic function that can
    help you understand it better is a
    painting by the famous French painter,
    Magritte.

    He painted a pipe and wrote the words
    “Ceci n’est pas une pipe” (this is not a
    pipe) below it.

    He wanted to make it clear that although
    the painting certainly evoked a pipe, it
    wasn’t actually a pipe.

    It is, in this case, a symbolic
    representation of a pipe.

    In this example, Magritte used the
    semiotic function to make art.

    However, human beings use symbolic
    representations every day.

## Further introduction {#further-introduction}

I had originally used AlephAlpha's world model
to help me describe Melee's artworks.

Firstly, I had attempted to describe them
myself. You can read about it in the link at
the top of this page.

-   The three artworks represent:
    -   The human soul, pure and optimistic
    -   An AI which thinks it is a real
        consciousness but is unaware that it exists
        on a canvas, perceivable to the observer.
    -   Love, fate, trust, oneness and connections with each-other beyond what we can see and observe


## Objectives {#objectives}

-   Create iNFTs from Melee's artworks
-   Enable them to generate their own ALI Tokens, to generate an income


## Step 1 - Create NFTs {#step-1-create-nfts}


## Step 2 - Create Personality Pods {#step-2-create-personality-pods}
