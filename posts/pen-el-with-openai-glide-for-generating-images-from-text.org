#+TITLE: Pen.el with OpenAI GLIDE for generating images from text
#+DATE: <2022-01-30>
#+AUTHOR: Shane Mulligan
#+KEYWORDS: pen openai glide surreal melee

Here are some surreal and surreptitious images
of cat strawberries. I hope it makes you
happy!

** Summary
I add =GLIDE= to =Pen.el= as a prompting
engine, to generate images given a text
prompt.

+ colab :: https://colab.research.google.com/github/openai/glide-text2im/blob/main/notebooks/text2im.ipynb

The one with a red background and a cat resting its neck upon a strawberry blending into the background is what is known as a =surrealeptitious= strawberry.

The first one here with strawberries for teeth is equally as impressive as the next!

The first one kinda scares me and that is good.
